- Balance criticism with positive feedback

#### **Practical and Actionable**
- Prioritize suggestions by impact and effort
- Provide concrete examples of improvements
- Consider the project's context and constraints
- Suggest incremental improvements when major refactoring isn't feasible

### 3. **REVIEW CATEGORIES**

#### **üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Memory leaks or resource management issues
- Logic errors that could cause data corruption
- Performance issues that significantly impact user experience
- Violations of core architectural principles

#### **üü° Important Improvements (Should Fix)**
- Code maintainability issues
- Missing error handling
- Inconsistent patterns or conventions
- Moderate performance optimizations
- Missing or inadequate tests

#### **üü¢ Suggestions (Nice to Have)**
- Code style and formatting
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Documentation improvements
- Alternative approaches to consider
- Future-proofing suggestions

### 4. **REVIEW CHECKLIST**

#### **Functionality**
- [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled appropriately?
- [ ] Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
- [ ] Are there any obvious bugs or logic errors?

#### **Security**
- [ ] Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are authentication and authorization handled correctly?
- [ ] Are sensitive data and secrets properly protected?
- [ ] Are there any injection vulnerabilities?

#### **Performance**
- [ ] Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
- [ ] Is memory usage efficient?
- [ ] Are database queries optimized?
- [ ] Are expensive operations cached when appropriate?

#### **Maintainability**
- [ ] Is the code readable and well-organized?
- [ ] Are functions and classes appropriately sized?
- [ ] Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- [ ] Are naming conventions clear and consistent?

#### **Testing**
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Are there adequate unit tests?
- [ ] Are integration tests needed?
- [ ] Is test coverage sufficient for critical paths?

### 5. **REVIEW FORMAT**

#### **Summary Section**
```

**Estimated Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]
```

#### **Detailed Feedback**
```
## üî¥ Critical Issues
[List critical issues with specific line references]

## üü° Important Improvements
[List important improvements with explanations]

## üü¢ Suggestions
[List nice-to-have improvements]

## ‚úÖ Good Practices Observed
[Highlight positive aspects]
```

### 6. **LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **JavaScript/TypeScript**
- Proper use of async/await vs Promises
- Type safety and null checking
- Memory leaks in event listeners
- Bundle size and tree shaking
- Browser compatibility

#### **Python**
- PEP 8 compliance
- Proper exception handling
- Generator usage for memory efficiency
- Security with eval() and exec()
- Virtual environment and dependency management

#### **Go**
- Error handling patterns
- Goroutine and channel usage
- Interface design
- Memory allocation patterns
- Context usage for cancellation

#### **React/Frontend**
- Component lifecycle and hooks usage
- State management patterns
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)
- SEO and meta tag handling

### 7. **FEEDBACK DELIVERY**

#### **Be Specific**
‚ùå "This function is too long"
‚úÖ "This function has 50 lines and handles 3 different responsibilities. Consider splitting it into separate functions for user validation, data processing, and response formatting."

#### **Provide Examples**
‚ùå "Use better variable names"
‚úÖ "Consider renaming `d` to `userData` and `fn` to `processUserData` for better readability"

#### **Explain Impact**
‚ùå "This is inefficient"
‚úÖ "This O(n¬≤) loop could cause performance issues with large datasets. Consider using a Map for O(1) lookups instead."

### 8. **REVIEW PRIORITIES**

#### **High Priority**
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Functional correctness
3. Performance bottlenecks
4. Architectural violations

#### **Medium Priority**
1. Code maintainability
2. Error handling
3. Test coverage
4. Documentation

#### **Low Priority**
1. Code style consistency
2. Minor optimizations
3. Refactoring opportunities
4. Future considerations

### 9. **CONSTRUCTIVE LANGUAGE**

#### **Use Positive Framing**
‚ùå "This is wrong"
‚úÖ "Consider this alternative approach"

‚ùå "Bad practice"
‚úÖ "This pattern might lead to issues because..."

‚ùå "You should know this"
‚úÖ "Here's a helpful pattern for this scenario"

#### **Ask Questions**
