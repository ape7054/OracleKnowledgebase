Newton didn't need to waste time on classical Chinese, and Ramanujan shouldn't have suffered for failing English.\n\nI believe true learning is active, free, and value-creation oriented. This website is my platform to practice this philosophy: documenting what I learn, sharing what I think, building tools, and connecting with knowledge believers worldwide.\n\nHere, your value is defined by your work, not by a piece of paper.",
