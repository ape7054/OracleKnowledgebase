# GitHub API Configuration (Optional)
# Adding a GitHub token increases the API rate limit from 60 to 5000 requests per hour
# This helps prevent "Failed to fetch user data" errors due to rate limiting
#
# To create a GitHub token:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
# 3. Give it a name (e.g., "Oracle Knowledge Base")
# 4. Select scopes: only "public_repo" or "repo" (read-only) is needed
# 5. Generate and copy the token
# 6. Create a .env.local file and add the line below with your token
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env.local to git! It should be in .gitignore

# For client-side access (if needed in browser):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# For server-side only (recommended for security):
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
